# Triana y Luca ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/trianayluca))
Transmitting a **sincere** and **intimate** sound, Triana and Luca are two curious artists exploring their diasporic roots through music. Intertwining Ibero-American **folklores** with contemporary influences, their melodies oscillate between popular music, improvisation, and poetry. 

Their project proposes a journey full of visual and poetic stimuli, inspired by **cultural traditions**, creative freedom, **religious syncretism** in art, nature, poetry and mysticism.
